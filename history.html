               <p> Drum and bass (also written as Drum&Bass or drum'n'bass and commonly abbreviated
                as D&B, DnB, or D'n'B) is a genre of electronic music characterised by fast breakbeats (
                typically 165-185 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, samples, 
                and synthesizers. The genre grew out of the UK's jungle scene in the early 1990s.<p>
                The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles. A major
                influence was the original Jamaican dub and reggae sound that influenced jungle's bass-heavy sound. Another feature of 
                the style is the complex syncopation of the drum tracks' breakbeat.</p>
                <br>
                Drum and bass subgenres include breakcore, ragga 
                jungle, hardstep, darkstep, techstep, neurofunk, ambient drum and bass, liquid funk (a.k.a. liquid drum and bass), jump up,
                drumfunk, sambass, and drill 'n' bass. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like hip hop, big beat, dubstep, house,
                trip hop, ambient music, techno, jazz, rock and pop.<p>
                <br>
                Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. Major international music labels
                had shown very little interest in the drum and bass 
                scene until BMG Rights Management acquired RAM in February
                2016. Since then, the genre has seen a significant growth 
                in exposure.</p><p> The origin and home of drum and bass music is in the UK,
                with other prominent fanbases located in Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
                United States, and South Africa. There's also a modest following in countries 
                like Austria, Russia, Estonia, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and more.
